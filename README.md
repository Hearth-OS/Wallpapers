# Hearth Wallpapers
Wallpapers for Hearth OS

If you'd like to install the wallpapers, you can clone the repo and go from there. With most systems, cloning would be something like
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Hearth-OS/Wallpapers/
```
after which, you can go to the directory containing the wallp[apers and browse around.

## General wallpaper guidelines


* Avoid grainy images, excpet for acceptable vintage ISO levels
* Both digital and abstract photos are allowed
* Wallpapers should be at least 1920x1080p
* Use common sense, and think of others before yourself

### For Reference

Here are two brief examples of what the two main Hearth Desktops will look like.

```insert Lumina DE scrot```

*`with Lumina DE`*


```insert i3wm/i3-gaps scrot```

*`with i3wm/i3-gaps`*
